# Product Context — Bourne Bridge Safety Site

## Why this site exists

MassDOT’s current plan for the new Bourne Bridge ends the multimodal path at an **at-grade crossing of Sandwich Rd**, controlled only by a flashing beacon. This creates a high-conflict point where fast vehicle traffic intersects people walking and biking, including during large events.

The site exists to:
- **Explain the problem** with clear visuals and concise language.
- **Show a feasible alternative** (a grade-separated multimodal overpass) that leverages existing grades.
- **Channel urgency into concrete actions** visitors can take during the limited public comment window.

## Key user flows

1. **Landing → Understanding the issue**
   - See urgent banner about comment deadline.
   - Read hero headline and subcopy to understand the core ask (fix the path crossing, build an overpass).
   - Optionally scroll to see images and the YouTube design video.

2. **Landing → Take action via MassDOT portal**
   - Scroll to "Submit a comment via the portal".
   - Skim suggested comment text.
   - Optionally personalize with their name/town and extra context.
   - Click **Copy comment**.
   - Click **Go to portal and paste copied comment** (opens MassDOT site in new tab).

3. **Landing → Add name to coalition submission**
   - Scroll to "Add your name (coalition support)".
   - Understand that a prepared PDF comment exists and they can co-sign.
   - Either:
     - Fill out the embedded Google Form, or
     - Click **Open form in new tab** to complete it directly on Google.

4. **Landing → Share the page**
   - Click the **Share** button in the hero.
   - On devices that support the Web Share API, share via native share sheet.
   - Otherwise, the page URL is copied to clipboard with a small alert.

5. **Landing → Learn more / validate concern**
   - Watch the embedded MassDOT design video.
   - Review the “why at-grade is risky” and “benefits of an overpass” sections.
   - Read supporting quotes (e.g., from Best Buddies).

## Experience & tone goals
- **Urgent but constructive**: Emphasize the deadline and safety concern without being alarmist.
- **Actionable**: Every explanation is paired with a clear next step (comment, attend, sign, share).
- **Respectful of user time**: Pre-drafted comments, one-page layout, minimal navigation.
- **Device-friendly**: Works well on mobile and desktop (responsive Tailwind layout).

## What success looks like for users
- They quickly understand the safety issue and proposed fix.
- They feel confident submitting a comment, even if they aren’t transportation experts.
- They can easily share the issue with friends, fellow riders, or local groups.
- They can show solidarity by adding their name even if they don’t want to navigate the MassDOT portal directly.

## What success looks like for maintainers/advocates
- Clear visibility (via analytics) into:
  - How many people are clicking through to the portal.
  - How often the suggested comment is being copied.
  - How frequently the coalition form is opened or its link copied.
- Ability to tweak copy or layout later and see whether those changes affect engagement.
