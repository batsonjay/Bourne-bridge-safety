🚨 PUBLIC COMMENT ON BOURNE BRIDGE CLOSES TOMORROW (Oct 24) - CYCLIST ACTION NEEDED 🚨

The new Bourne Bridge will include a multimodal path — great news! But the current design ends with an at-grade crossing of Sandwich Rd, where highway-speed traffic meets cyclists - with bad results.

The planned flashing beacon as control won't stop physics.

We're urging MassDOT to evaluate a grade-separated overpass instead — safer for everyone, makes for awesome weekend club rides, and keeps major events like PMC and Best Buddies from shutting down roadways. A multi-modal grade overpass simply takes advantage of the existing elevation to make it awesome for everyone.
